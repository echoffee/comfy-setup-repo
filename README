A set of scripts to set up a working WSL environment after a massive fuckup or a new Windows installation.

Beware :
    The script clones some stuff from my Github private repositories, so of course the script won't really work
    for other people lol

What it does
--------------------
1. System update
2. Generate SSH key
3. Apply ricing, shortcuts and binaries saved on https://github.com/echoffee/comfy-env
4. Install a few tools such as Ranger
5. Install the Vim environment saved at the same place as 3.
6. Apply links to /mnt/ drives
7. Give commands to save all of this

1. Clone this repo : 
    git clone https://github.com/echoffee/comfy-setup-repo
